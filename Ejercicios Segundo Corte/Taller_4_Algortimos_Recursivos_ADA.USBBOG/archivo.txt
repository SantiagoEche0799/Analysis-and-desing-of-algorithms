needless to say, i keep her in check
she was all bad-bad, nevertheless
calling it quits now, baby, i'm a wreck
crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
needless to say, i keep her in check
she was all bad-bad, nevertheless
callin' it quits now, baby, i'm a wreck
crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
thinking in a bad way, losing your grip
screaming at my face, baby, don't trip
someone took a big l, i don't know how that felt
looking at you sideways, party on tilt
some things you just can't refuse
she wanna ride like a cruise and i'm not tryna lose
then you're left in the dust
unless i stuck by ya
you're a sunflower
i think your love would be too much
or you'll be left in the dust
unless i stuck by ya
you're the sunflower
you're the sunflower
every time i'm leaving on ya
you don't make it easy, no
wish i could be there for you
give me a reason to go
every time i'm walking out
i can hear you telling me to turn around
fighting for my trust and you won't back down
even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh
i know you're scared of the unknown
you don't wanna be alone
i know i always come and go
but it's out of my control
and you'll be left in the dust
unless i stuck by ya
you're the sunflower
i think your love would be too much
or you'll be left in the dust
unless i stuck by ya
you're the sunflower
you're the sunflower
